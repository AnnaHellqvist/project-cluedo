# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Focus for this assignment has been to dig deeper into objects, arrays and functions. Use that knowledge and build a mystery randomizer.

## The problem

Started by solving the iterations given in the project brief,
and from there added/changed functions, and added object propertys. Manipulating the DOM to display the data stored in the objects.
I added the shuffle weapon function, which randomly picks a weapon from the array and assign it as a value to the object of the suspect. '

If I had more time I would have:
- put some more effort into styling.
- added an animation to flip the cards when they are picked. I tried but felt I needed some more time to get it right.
- made it responsive.
